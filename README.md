## Description

It is not unusual for a person to have recurring undiagnosed health issues. One way to effectively solve the problem is to track your everyday activities and meals, and what symptoms arise alongside them. Parallels can be drawn from having logged information like this which can help in diagnosis. <br>
This app will help a user log and keep track of their symptoms. A user will be able to see a list of all their entries which can be sorted in different ways to help them see a pattern and hopefully live a healthier, more comfortable lifestyle for them. <br>
